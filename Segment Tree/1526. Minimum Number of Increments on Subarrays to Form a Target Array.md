> Given an array of positive integers `target` and an array `initial` of same size with all zeros.
>
> Return the minimum number of operations to form a `target` array from `initial` if you are allowed to do the following operation:
> * Choose **any** subarray from `initial` and increment each value by one.
>
> The answer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: target = [1,2,3,2,1]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: We need at least 3 operations to form the target array from the initial array.
> [0,0,0,0,0] increment 1 from index 0 to 4 (inclusive).
> [1,1,1,1,1] increment 1 from index 1 to 3 (inclusive).
> [1,2,2,2,1] increment 1 at index 2.
> [1,2,3,2,1] target array is formed.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: target = [3,1,1,2]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: (initial)[0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1] -> [1,1,1,2] -> [2,1,1,2] -> [3,1,1,2] (target).
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: target = [3,1,5,4,2]
> Output: 7
> Explanation: (initial)[0,0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1,1] -> [2,1,1,1,1] -> [3,1,1,1,1]
>                                   -> [3,1,2,2,2] -> [3,1,3,3,2] -> [3,1,4,4,2] -> [3,1,5,4,2] (target).
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: target = [1,1,1,1]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= target[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * **got from the discuss** `Runtime: 3 ms, faster than 86.41%, Memory Usage: 48.9 MB, less than 52.67% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(N)time
      // O(1)space
      public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
          int res = target[0];
          for(int i = 1; i < target.length; i++){
              int d;
              if((d = target[i] - target[i - 1]) > 0){
                  res += d;
              }
          }
          return res;
      }
      ```
