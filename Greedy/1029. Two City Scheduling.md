# [1029. Two City Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/)
---

> There are `2N` people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city `A` is `costs[i][0]`, and the cost of flying the `i-th` person to city `B` is `costs[i][1]`.
>
> Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `N` people arrive in each city.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
> Output: 110
> Explanation:
> The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
> The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
> The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
> The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
>
> The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `1 <= costs.length <= 100`
> * It is guaranteed that `costs.length` is even.
> * `1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000`
