> At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`.
>
> Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by `bills`).
>
> Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.
>
> Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.
>
> Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
> Output: true
> Explanation:
> From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
> From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
> From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
> Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [5,5,10]
> Output: true
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: [10,10]
> Output: false
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
> Output: false
> Explanation:
> From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
> For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
> For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
> Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `0 <= bills.length <= 10000`
> * `bills[i]` will be either `5`, `10`, or `20`.
