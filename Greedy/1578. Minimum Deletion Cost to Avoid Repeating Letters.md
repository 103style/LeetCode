> Given a string `s` and an array of integers `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of deleting the i<sup>th</sup> character in `s`.
>
> Return the minimum cost of deletions such that there are no two identical letters next to each other.
>
> Notice that you will delete the chosen characters at the same time, in other words, after deleting a character, the costs of deleting other characters will not change.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: s = "abaac", cost = [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Delete the letter "a" with cost 3 to get "abac" (String without two identical letters next to each other).
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "abc", cost = [1,2,3]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: You don't need to delete any character because there are no identical letters next to each other.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: s = "aabaa", cost = [1,2,3,4,1]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: Delete the first and the last character, getting the string ("aba").
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `s.length == cost.length`
> * `1 <= s.length, cost.length <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= cost[i] <= 10^4`
> * `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
