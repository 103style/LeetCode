> Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
> Output: 1
> Explanation:
> Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
> Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
> Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
> So we only need 1 patch.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
> Output: 0
> ```
