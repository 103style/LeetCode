Given a string `num` representing **the digits** of a very large integer and an integer `k`.

You are allowed to swap any two adjacent digits of the integer **at most** `k` times.

Return the minimum integer you can obtain also as a string.

 

### Example 1:
![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/17/q4_1.jpg)
```
Input: num = "4321", k = 4
Output: "1342"
Explanation: The steps to obtain the minimum integer from 4321 with 4 adjacent swaps are shown.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: num = "100", k = 1
Output: "010"
Explanation: It's ok for the output to have leading zeros, but the input is guaranteed not to have any leading zeros.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: num = "36789", k = 1000
Output: "36789"
Explanation: We can keep the number without any swaps.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: num = "22", k = 22
Output: "22"
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: num = "9438957234785635408", k = 23
Output: "0345989723478563548"
```

### Constraints:
* `1 <= num.length <= 30000`
* `num` contains **digits** only and doesn't have **leading zeros**.
* `1 <= k <= 10^9`
