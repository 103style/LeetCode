> Given an `n x n` binary `grid`, in one step you can choose two **adjacent rows** of the grid and swap them.
>
> A grid is said to be **valid** if all the cells above the main diagonal are **zeros**.
>
> Return the minimum number of steps needed to make the grid valid, or **-1** if the grid cannot be valid.
>
> The main diagonal of a grid is the diagonal that starts at cell `(1, 1)` and ends at cell `(n, n)`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/28/fw.jpg)
>
> ```
> Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,0]]
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/16/e2.jpg)
> ```
> Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0]]
> Output: -1
> Explanation: All rows are similar, swaps have no effect on the grid.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ![3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/16/e3.jpg)
> ```
> Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `n == grid.length`
> * `n == grid[i].length`
> * `1 <= n <= 200`
> * `grid[i][j] is 0 or 1`
