> The `i`-th person has weight `people[i]`, and each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`.
> 
> Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.
> 
> Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
> Output: 1
> Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
> Output: 4
> Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
> ```
> 
> ### Note:
> * `1 <= people.length <= 50000`
> * `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000`
