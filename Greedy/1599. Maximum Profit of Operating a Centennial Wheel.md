> You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has **four gondolas**, and each gondola has room for **up to four people**.
> You have the ability to rotate the gondolas **counterclockwise**, which costs you `runningCost` dollars.
>
> You are given an array `customers` of length n where `customers[i]` is the number of new customers arriving just before the i<sup>th</sup> rotation (0-indexed).
> This means you **must rotate the wheel** `i` **times before the** `customers[i]` **customers arrive**.
> **You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola**.
> Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.
>
> You can stop the wheel at any time, including **before serving all customers**.
> If you decide to stop serving customers, **all subsequent rotations are free** in order to get all the customers down safely.
> Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait **for the next rotation**.
>
> Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is **no scenario** where the profit is positive, return `-1`.

> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/wheeldiagram12.png)
> ```
> Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
> 1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
> 2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.
> 3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.
> The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4
> Output: 7
> Explanation:
> 1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $6 - 1 * $4 = $20.
> 2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.
> 3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.
> 4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.
> 5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.
> 6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.
> 7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 * $6 - 7 * $4 = $122.
> The highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92
> Output: -1
> Explanation:
> 1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 * $1 - 1 * $92 = -$89.
> 2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 2 * $92 = -$177.
> 3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 3 * $92 = -$269.
> 4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $1 - 4 * $92 = -$357.
> 5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 13 * $1 - 5 * $92 = -$447.
> The profit was never positive, so return -1.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: customers = [10,10,6,4,7], boardingCost = 3, runningCost = 8
> Output: 9
> Explanation:
> 1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $3 - 1 * $8 = $4.
> 2. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 12 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $3 - 2 * $8 = $8.
> 3. 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $3 - 3 * $8 = $12.
> 4. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $3 - 4 * $8 = $16.
> 5. 7 customers arrive, 4 board and 17 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $3 - 5 * $8 = $20.
> 6. 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $3 - 6 * $8 = $24.
> 7. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 28 * $3 - 7 * $8 = $28.
> 8. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 32 * $3 - 8 * $8 = $32.
> 9. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 36 * $3 - 9 * $8 = $36.
> 10. 1 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 37 * $3 - 10 * $8 = $31.
> The highest profit was $36 after rotating the wheel 9 times.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `n == customers.length`
> * `1 <= n <= 10^5`
> * `0 <= customers[i] <= 50`
> * `1 <= boardingCost, runningCost <= 100`
