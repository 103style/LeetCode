> There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is `gas[i]`.
>
> You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
>
> Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
>
> ### Note:
> * If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
> * Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
> * Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input:
> gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
> cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation:
> Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
> Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
> Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
> Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
> Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
> Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
> Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input:
> gas  = [2,3,4]
> cost = [3,4,3]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation:
> You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
> Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
> Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
> Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
> You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
> Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
> ```
