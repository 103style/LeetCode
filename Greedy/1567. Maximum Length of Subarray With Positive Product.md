> Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.
>
> A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of that array.
>
> Return the maximum length of a subarray with positive product.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,-2,-3,4]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: The array nums already has a positive product of 24.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: nums = [0,1,-2,-3,-4]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [1,-2,-3] which has a product of 6.
> Notice that we cannot include 0 in the subarray since that'll make the product 0 which is not positive.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,0,1]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [-1,-2] or [-2,-3].
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: nums = [-1,2]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,-6,4,0,10]
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
> * `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
