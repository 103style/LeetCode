> You are given an integer array `coins` of length `n` which represents the `n` coins that you own.
> The value of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> coin is `coins[i]`.
> You can **make** some value `x` if you can choose some of your `n` coins such that their values sum up to `x`.
>
> Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you **can make** with your coins **starting** from and **including** `0`.
>
> Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: coins = [1,3]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: You can make the following values:
> - 0: take []
> - 1: take [1]
> You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: coins = [1,1,1,4]
> Output: 8
> Explanation: You can make the following values:
> - 0: take []
> - 1: take [1]
> - 2: take [1,1]
> - 3: take [1,1,1]
> - 4: take [4]
> - 5: take [4,1]
> - 6: take [4,1,1]
> - 7: take [4,1,1,1]
> You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,4,10,3,1]
> Output: 20
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `coins.length == n`
> * `1 <= n <= 4 * 10^4`
> * `1 <= coins[i] <= 4 * 10^4`

      // O(N * Log(N))time
      // O(1)space
      public int getMaximumConsecutive(int[] coins) {
          Arrays.sort(coins);
          int t = 1;
          for(int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++){
              if(coins[i] <= t){
                  t += coins[i];
              }else{
