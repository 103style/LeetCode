> There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.
>
> An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with x<sub>start</sub> and x<sub>end</sub> bursts by an arrow shot at x if **x<sub>start</sub> ≤ x ≤ x<sub>end</sub>**. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.
>
> Given an array `points` where `points[i] = [x`<sub>start</sub>`, x`<sub>end</sub>`]`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
> Output: 2
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: points = [[1,2]]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: points = [[2,3],[2,3]]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `0 <= points.length <= 10^4`
> * `points.length == 2`
> * `-2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1`

      public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] p) {
          int n = p.length;
          if (n == 0) return 0;
          Arrays.sort(p, (o1, o2) -> Integer.compare(o1[1], o2[1]));
