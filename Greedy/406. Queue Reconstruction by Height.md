> Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
> 
> ### Note:
> * The number of people is less than 1,100.
> 
>  
> ### Example
> ```
> Input:
> [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
> 
> Output:
> [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
> ```
