> A decimal number is called **deci-binary** if each of its digits is either `0` or `1` without any leading zeros. 
> For example, `101` and `1100` are **deci-binary**, while `112` and `3001` are not.
> 
> Given a string `n` that represents a positive decimal integer, return the **minimum** number of positive **deci-binary** numbers needed so that they sum up to `n`.
> 
>  
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: n = "32"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: n = "82734"
> Output: 8
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
> Output: 9
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
> * `n` consists of only digits.
> * `n` does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.

      // O(n)time
      // O(n)space
      public int minPartitions(String n) {
          int res = 0;
          char[] arr = n.toCharArray();
          for (char c : arr) {
              int t = c - '0';
              res = Math.max(t, res);
          }
          return res;
      }
