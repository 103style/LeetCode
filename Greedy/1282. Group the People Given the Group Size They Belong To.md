# [1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-the-people-given-the-group-size-they-belong-to/)
---

> There are n people whose IDs go from 0 to n - 1 and each person belongs exactly to one group. Given the array groupSizes of length n telling the group size each person belongs to, return the groups there are and the people's IDs each group includes.
>
> You can return any solution in any order and the same applies for IDs. Also, it is guaranteed that there exists at least one solution.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
> Output: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
> Explanation:
> Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
> Output: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `groupSizes.length == n`
> * `1 <= n <= 500`
> * `1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n`

### Solution
* **java**
```
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> groupThePeople(int[] gz) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList();
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> groups = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < gz.length; ++i) {
            List<Integer> list = groups.computeIfAbsent(gz[i], k -> new ArrayList());
            list.add(i);
            if (list.size() == gz[i]) {
                res.add(list);
                groups.put(gz[i], new ArrayList());
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
