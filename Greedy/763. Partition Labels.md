# 763. [Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)

A string `S` of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

### Example 1:
```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```
### Note:
* `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
* `S` will consist of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.

```
public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String S) {
    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
    int i = 0;
    int end = S.lastIndexOf(S.charAt(0));
    if (end != 0) {
        for (i = 0; i < end; i++) {
            char c = S.charAt(i);
            int t = S.lastIndexOf(c);
            if (t > end) {
                end = t;
            }
        }
    }
    i++;
    res.add(i);
    if (i < S.length()) {
        res.addAll(partitionLabels(S.substring(i)));
    }
    return res;
}
```
