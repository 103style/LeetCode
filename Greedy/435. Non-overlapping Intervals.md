> Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
> * Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

  * **Java**
    * `Runtime: 5 ms, faster than 25.57%, Memory Usage: 42.3 MB, less than 10.65% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(N*logN)time
      // O(N) or O(1)space depends on arrays.sort
      public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
          if (intervals == null || intervals.length < 2) return 0;
          Arrays.sort(intervals, (o1, o2) -> o1[1] - o2[1]);
          int res = 0;
          int end = intervals[0][1];
          for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
              if (intervals[i][0] < end) {
                  res++;
