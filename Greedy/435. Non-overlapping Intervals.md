> Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
> * Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
