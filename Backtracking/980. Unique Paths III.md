# 980. [Unique Paths III](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/)

On a 2-dimensional `grid`, there are 4 types of squares:

* `1` represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
* `2` represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
* `0` represents empty squares we can walk over.
* `-1` represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that **walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once**.

 

### Example 1:
    Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
    1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
    2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
    
### Example 2:
    Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
    1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
    2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
    3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
    4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)

### Example 3:
    Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: 
    There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
    Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.
 

### Note:
* 1 <= grid.length * grid[0].length <= 20
