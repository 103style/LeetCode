> Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.
>
> Implement the `ParkingSystem` class:
> * `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)` Initializes object of the `ParkingSystem` class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
> * `bool addCar(int carType)` Checks whether there is a parking space of `carType` for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. `carType` can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively. **A car can only park in a parking space of its** `carType`. If there is no space available, return `false`, else park the car in that size space and return `true`.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input
> ["ParkingSystem", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar"]
> [[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
> Output
> [null, true, true, false, false]
>
> Explanation
> ParkingSystem parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
> parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
> parkingSystem.addCar(2); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
> parkingSystem.addCar(3); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
> parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car. It is already occupied.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `0 <= big, medium, small <= 1000`
> * `carType` is `1`, `2`, or `3`
> * At most `1000` calls will be made to `addCar`

          public ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) {
              park = new int[4];
              park[1] = big;
              park[2] = medium;
              park[3] = small;
          }

          public boolean addCar(int carType) {
              if(park[carType] == 0) return false;
              park[carType]--;
              return true;
          }
      }
