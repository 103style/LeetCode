> Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.
>
> In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.
>
> Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.
>
> ### Note:
> Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input:
> s = "ABAB", k = 2
>
> Output:
> 4
>
> Explanation:
> Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input:
> s = "AABABBA", k = 1
>
> Output:
> 4
>
> Explanation:
> Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
> The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
> ```
