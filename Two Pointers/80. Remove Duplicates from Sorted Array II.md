---

> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
>
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
>
> Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
>
> It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],
>
> Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
>
> It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> ### Clarification:
>
> Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
>
> Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
>
> Internally you can think of this:
> ```
> // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
> int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
>
> // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
> // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
>     print(nums[i]);
> }
> ```

      ```
      // O(N)time
      // O(1)space
      public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
          int n = nums.length;
          if(n == 0) return 0;
          int l = 1;
          int count = 1;
          for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
              if(nums[i] == nums[i - 1]){
                  count++;
                  if(count <= 2){
