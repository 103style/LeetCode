Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
``` 

### Note:
* `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
* `0 <= K <= A.length`
* `A[i]` is `0` or `1`
