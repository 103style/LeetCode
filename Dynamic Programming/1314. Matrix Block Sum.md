# [1314. Matrix Block Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-block-sum/)

Given a `m * n` matrix mat and an integer `K`, return a matrix answer where each `answer[i][j]` is the sum of all elements `mat[r][c]` 
for `i - K <= r <= i + K, j - K <= c <= j + K`, and `(r, c)` is a valid position in the matrix.
 

### Example 1:
```
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], K = 1
Output: [[12,21,16],[27,45,33],[24,39,28]]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], K = 2
Output: [[45,45,45],[45,45,45],[45,45,45]]
```
