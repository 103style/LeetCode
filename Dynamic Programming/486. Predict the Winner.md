> Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.
>
> Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [1, 5, 2]
> Output: False
> Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.
> If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).
> So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.
> Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]
> Output: True
> Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
> Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * 1 <= length of the array <= 20.
> * Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.
> * If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.

  * **Java**
    * **DP** `Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 36.6 MB, less than 92.36% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      //O(N^2)time
      //O(N^2)space
      public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
          int n =  nums.length;
          //if len is even, then just two plan, if A loss, we choose B, so we always win
          if(n % 2 == 0 || n < 2) return true;

          int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
          for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
              dp[i][i] = nums[i];
          }
          // dp[i][j] = Math.max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
          // dp[i][j] means the sum in range [i, j] player1  - player2
          for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--){
              for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++){
                  dp[i][j] = Math.max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
              }
          }
          return dp[0][n - 1] >= 0;
      }
      ```
