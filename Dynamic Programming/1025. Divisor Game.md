> Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
>
> Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
>
> * Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
> * Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.
>
> Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
>
> Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: 2
> Output: true
> Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: 3
> Output: false
> Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `1 <= N <= 1000`

  * **Java**
    * `Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 35.9 MB, less than 84.88% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(1)time
      // O(1)space
      
      //if you want to win, you will make the last you face is 2.
      // when N is odd, whatever your choose, N will be even.
      // if N is even, you just make N change to odd. so your next N is also even. 
      // final you will got 2, and you choose 1, and you win.
      public boolean divisorGame(int N) {
        return N % 2 == 0;
      }
      ```
