# [1025. Divisor Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/)
---

> Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
>
> Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
>
> * Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
> * Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.
>
> Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
>
> Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: 2
> Output: true
> Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: 3
> Output: false
> Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `1 <= N <= 1000`

  public boolean divisorGame(int N) {
    return N % 2 == 0;
  }
  ```
  * if N = 12;
  * Alice choose x = 6,  N = 12 - 6 = 6;（if Alice want to win, Alice will never choose x = 6, Alice will choose x to make `N - x`  is odd）
  * Bob choose x = 3,  N = 6 - 3 = 3;
  * Alice choose x = 1,  N = 3 - 1 = 2;
  * Bob choose x = 1,  N = 2 - 1 = 1;
  * Alice is lose！
