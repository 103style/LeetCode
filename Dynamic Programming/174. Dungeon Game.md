> The demons had captured the princess (**P**) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (**K**) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
>
> The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
>
> Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
>
> In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
>
>
>
> **Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.**
>
> For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path `RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.
>
> | -2 (K) | -3 | 3 |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | 5 | -10 | 1 |
> | 10 | 30 | -5 (P) |
>
>
> ### Note:
> * The knight's health has no upper bound.
> * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
