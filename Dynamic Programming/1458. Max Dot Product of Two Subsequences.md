# [1458. Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-dot-product-of-two-subsequences/)
---

> Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
>
> Return the maximum dot product between **non-empty** subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.
>
> A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
> Output: 18
> Explanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.
> Their dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7]
> Output: 21
> Explanation: Take subsequence [3] from nums1 and subsequence [7] from nums2.
> Their dot product is (3*7) = 21.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: nums1 = [-1,-1], nums2 = [1,1]
> Output: -1
> Explanation: Take subsequence [-1] from nums1 and subsequence [1] from nums2.
> Their dot product is -1.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
> * `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
