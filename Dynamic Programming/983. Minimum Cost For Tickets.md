# [983. Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)

In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`.  Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
* a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
* a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
* a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

### Note:
* `1 <= days.length <= 365`
* `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
* `days` is in strictly increasing order.
* `costs.length == 3`
* `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

            int index = day + t - 1;

            dp[index] = Math.min(dp[index], getCost(dp, index - 30) + costs[2]);
        }
        return dp[days[days.length - 1] + t - 1];
    }

    public int getCost(int[] dp, int index) {
        if (dp[index] == -1) {
            dp[index] = getCost(dp, index - 1);
        }
        return dp[index];
    }
