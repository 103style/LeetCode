> In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`.  Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.
>
> Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
> * a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
> * a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
> * a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.
>
> The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
>
> Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
> Output: 11
> Explanation:
> For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
> On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
> On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
> On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
> In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
> Output: 17
> Explanation:
> For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
> On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
> On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
> In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `1 <= days.length <= 365`
> * `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
> * `days` is in strictly increasing order.
> * `costs.length == 3`
> * `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`
