# [518. Coin Change 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/)
---

> You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
> 5=5
> 5=2+2+1
> 5=2+1+1+1
> 5=1+1+1+1+1
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> You can assume that
> * `0 <= amount <= 5000`
> * `1 <= coin <= 5000`
> * the number of coins is less than 500
> * the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * **Dynamic Programming**   same as [70. Climbing Stairs.](https://github.com/103style/LeetCode/blob/master/Dynamic%20Programming/70.%20Climbing%20Stairs.md)
    
      `Runtime: 3 ms, faster than 61.40%, Memory Usage: 36.9 MB, less than 75.53% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(N*M)time O(N)space
      // N is amount,  M is coins.length
      public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
          int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
          dp[0] = 1;
          for(int coin : coins){
              for(int j = coin; j <= amount; j++){
                  dp[j] += dp[j - coin];
              }
          }
          return dp[amount];
      }
      ```
