# [518. Coin Change 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/)

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
``` 

### Note:
You can assume that
* `0 <= amount <= 5000`
* `1 <= coin <= 5000`
* the number of coins is less than 500
* the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

      ```
      // O(N*M)time O(N)space
      // N is amount,  M is coins.length
      public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
          int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
          dp[0] = 1;
          for(int coin : coins){
              for(int j = coin; j <= amount; j++){
                  dp[j] += dp[j - coin];
              }
          }
          return dp[amount];
      }
      ```
