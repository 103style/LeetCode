> Your are given an array of integers `prices`, for which the `i`-th element is the price of a given stock on day `i`; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction `fee`.
>
> You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)
>
> Return the maximum profit you can make.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
> Output: 8
> Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
> Buying at prices[0] = 1
> Selling at prices[3] = 8
> Buying at prices[4] = 4
> Selling at prices[5] = 9
> The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `0 < prices.length <= 50000.`
> * `0 < prices[i] < 50000.`
> * `0 <= fee < 50000.`
