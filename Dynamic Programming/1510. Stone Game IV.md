> Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
> 
> Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing **any** non-zero **square number** of stones in the pile.
> 
> Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.
> 
> Given a positive integer `n`. Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `False`, assuming both players play optimally.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: n = 1
> Output: true
> Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: n = 2
> Output: false
> Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 4
> Output: true
> Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
> ```
> 
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: n = 7
> Output: false
> Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
> If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
> If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
> ```
> 
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: n = 17
> Output: false
> Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= n <= 10^5`

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * `Runtime: 2 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 36.6 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      //O(N)time
      //O(N)space
      public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
          boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
          for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
              if(dp[i]){
                  continue;
              }
              for(int j = 1; i + j * j <= n; j++){
                  dp[i + j * j] = true;
              }
          }
          return dp[n];
      }
      ```
