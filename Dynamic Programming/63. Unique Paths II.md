---

**leetcode-cn Daily Challenge on July 6th, 2020.**

---

> **Difficulty** : **Medium**

---

> A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
>
> The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
>
> Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
>
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)
>
>
> An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
>
> **Note**: m and n will be at most 100.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input:
> [
>   [0,0,0],
>   [0,1,0],
>   [0,0,0]
> ]
> Output: 2
> Explanation:
> There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
> There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
> 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
> 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
> ```
