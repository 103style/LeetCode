> There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:
> * Eat one orange.
> * If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by 2 then you can eat  n/2 oranges.
> * If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by 3 then you can eat  2*(n/3) oranges.
> 
> You can only choose one of the actions per day.
> 
> Return the minimum number of days to eat `n` oranges.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: n = 10
> Output: 4
> Explanation: You have 10 oranges.
> Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.
> Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
> Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1.
> Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
> You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: n = 6
> Output: 3
> Explanation: You have 6 oranges.
> Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).
> Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)
> Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
> You need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 1
> Output: 1
> ```
> 
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: n = 56
> Output: 6
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= n <= 2*10^9`
