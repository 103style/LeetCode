> Given an array `nums` that represents a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of `nums` in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder `nums` so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array `nums`.
>
> For example, given `nums = [2,1,3]`, we will have 2 as the root, 1 as a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array `[2,3,1]` also yields the same BST but `[3,2,1]` yields a different BST.
>
> Return the number of ways to reorder `nums` such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from `nums`.
>
> Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/12/bb.png)
> ```
> Input: nums = [2,1,3]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: We can reorder nums to be [2,3,1] which will yield the same BST. There are no other ways to reorder nums which will yield the same BST.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/12/ex1.png)
> ```
> Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: The following 5 arrays will yield the same BST:
> [3,1,2,4,5]
> [3,1,4,2,5]
> [3,1,4,5,2]
> [3,4,1,2,5]
> [3,4,1,5,2]
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ![3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/12/ex4.png)
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,2,3]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: There are no other orderings of nums that will yield the same BST.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ![4](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/12/abc.png)
> ```
> Input: nums = [3,1,2,5,4,6]
> Output: 19
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: nums = [9,4,2,1,3,6,5,7,8,14,11,10,12,13,16,15,17,18]
> Output: 216212978
> Explanation: The number of ways to reorder nums to get the same BST is 3216212999. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives 216212978.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
> * `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`
> * All integers in `nums` are **distinct**.
