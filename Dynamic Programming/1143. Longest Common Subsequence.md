# [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)
---

> Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
>
> A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
>
>
> If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
> * `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
> * The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
