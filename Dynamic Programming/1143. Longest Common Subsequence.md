# [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

### Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

### Constraints:
* `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
* The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
