> **Difficulty** : **Medium**
> 
> **Related Topics** : **Array**、**Dynamic Programming**

---

> Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
>
> **Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input:
> [
>   [1,3,1],
>   [1,5,1],
>   [4,2,1]
> ]
> Output: 7
> Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
