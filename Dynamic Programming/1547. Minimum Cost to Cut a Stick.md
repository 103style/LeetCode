> Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length **6** is labelled as follows:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/21/statement.jpg)
>
> Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.
>
> You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.
>
> The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.
>
> Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.
>

>
> ### Example 1:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/23/e1.jpg)
> ```
> Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
> Output: 16
> Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
> ```
> ![3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/21/e11.jpg)
> ```
> The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
> Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]
> Output: 22
> Explanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.
> There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= n <= 10^6`
> * `1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`
> * `1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
> * All the integers in `cuts` array are **distinct**.
