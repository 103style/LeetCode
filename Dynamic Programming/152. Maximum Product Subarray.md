> Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [2,3,-2,4]
> Output: 6
> Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [-2,0,-1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
