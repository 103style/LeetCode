> Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.
>
> Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, `M = 1`.
>
> On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the **first** `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`.  Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`.
>
> The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
>
> Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
> Output: 10
> Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger.
> ```

> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= piles.length <= 100`
> * `1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4`
