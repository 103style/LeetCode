> We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees.
> It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.
>
> You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.
>
> **All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**.
> This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**.
> For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`,
> there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.
>
> Return *the maximum number of achievable requests*.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move1.jpg)
> ```
> Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
> Output: 5
> Explantion: Let's see the requests:
> From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
> From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
> From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
> From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
> From building 4 we don't have any requests.
> We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
> We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move2.jpg)
> ```
> Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
> Output: 3
> Explantion: Let's see the requests:
> From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
> From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
> From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
> We can achieve all the requests.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> #### Constraints:
> * `1 <= n <= 20`
> * `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
> * `requests[i].length == 2`
> * `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
