# [837. New 21 Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/)
---

> Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
>
> Alice starts with `0` points, and draws numbers while she has less than `K` points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, W]`, where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
>
> Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points.  What is the probability that she has `N` or less points?
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
> Output: 1.00000
> Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
> Output: 0.60000
> Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
> In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
> Output: 0.73278
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `0 <= K <= N <= 10000`
> * `1 <= W <= 10000`
> * Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within `10^-5` of the correct answer.
> * The judging time limit has been reduced for this question.
