> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
>
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,1]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
>              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
> Output: 12
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
>              Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
> ```
