> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
>
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [2,3,2]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
>              because they are adjacent houses.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,1]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
>              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
> ```
