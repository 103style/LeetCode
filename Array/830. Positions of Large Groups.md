> In a string `s` of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.
> 
> For example, a string like `s = "abbxxxxzyy"` has the groups `"a"`, `"bb"`, `"xxxx"`, `"z"`, and `"yy"`.
> 
> A group is identified by an interval `[start, end]`, where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group.
> In the above example, `"xxxx"` has the interval `[3,6]`.
> 
> A group is considered **large** if it has 3 or more characters.
> 
> Return the intervals of every **large** group sorted in **increasing order by start index**.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
> Output: [[3,6]]
> Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "abc"
> Output: []
> Explanation: We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
> Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
> Explanation: The large groups are "ddd", "eeee", and "bbb".
> ```
> 
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: s = "aba"
> Output: []
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
> * `s` contains lower-case English letters only.
