> Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a **strictly increasing order**, and an integer `k`.
>
> Find the `k`<sup>`th`</sup> positive integer that is missing from this array.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
> Output: 9
> Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
> Output: 6
> Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
> * `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
> * `1 <= k <= 1000`
> * `arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

      public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
          int j = 1;
          int count = 0;
          for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
              while(arr[i] != j){
                  count++;
                  if(count == k) return j;
                  j++;

              if(arr[i] == j) j++;
          }
          return j + (k - count - 1);
      }
      ```
