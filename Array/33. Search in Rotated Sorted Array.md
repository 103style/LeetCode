# [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

    //O(logN)time O(1)space
    int search(int[] A, int target) {
        int n = A.length;
        int lo = 0, hi = n - 1;
        // find the index of the smallest value using binary search.
        // Loop will terminate since mid < hi, and lo or hi will shrink by at least 1.
        // Proof by contradiction that mid < hi: if mid==hi, then lo==hi and loop would have been terminated.
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (A[mid] > A[hi]) lo = mid + 1;
            else hi = mid;
        }
        // lo==hi is the index of the smallest value and also the number of places rotated.
        int rot = lo;
        lo = 0;
        hi = n - 1;
        // The usual binary search and accounting for rotation.
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            int realmid = (mid + rot) % n;
            if (A[realmid] == target) return realmid;
