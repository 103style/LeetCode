# [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
---

> Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
>
> (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).
>
> You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
>
> You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
>
> Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
> Output: -1
> ```
