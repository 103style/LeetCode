> Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
>
> ### Note
> You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
> Output: 49

      public int maxArea(int[] height) {
          int len = height.length;
          int res = 0;
          int l = 0, r = len - 1;
          while(l < r){
              res = Math.max(res, Math.min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l));
              if(height[l] > height[r]){
                  r--;
              }else if(height[l] < height[r]){
                  l++;
              }else{
