> Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
> 
> The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
> 
> ### Note
> * Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
> * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
> 
> 
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
> Output: [1,2]
> Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
> ```
