# 674. [Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/description/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).

### Example 1:
    Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
    Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
### Example 2:
    Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
### Note: 
* Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

// O(n)time O(1)space
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        if(nums.length == 1){
            return 1;
        }
        int max = 1, temp = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] > nums[i - 1]){
                temp++;
                max = Math.max(temp, max);
            }else{
                temp = 1;       
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
