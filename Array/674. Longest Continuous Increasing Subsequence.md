---

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
> Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
