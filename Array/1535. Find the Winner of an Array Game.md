> Given an integer `array` arr of **distinct** integers and an integer `k`.
>
> A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`, the larger integer wins and remains at position `0` and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds.
>
> Return the integer which will win the game.
>
> It is **guaranteed** that there will be a winner of the game.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
> Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
>   1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
>   2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
>   3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
>   4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
> So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,9,8,2,3,7,6,4,5], k = 7
> Output: 9
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99], k = 1000000000
> Output: 99
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
> * `arr` contains **distinct** integers.
> * `1 <= k <= 10^9`

      public int getWinner(int[] arr, int k) {
          int res = arr[0];
          int count = 0;
          for(int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
              if(arr[i] > res){
                  count = 1;
                  res = arr[i];
