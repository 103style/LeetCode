# [1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap](https://leetcode.com/problems/previous-permutation-with-one-swap/)

Given an array `A` of positive integers (not necessarily distinct), return the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than `A`, that can be **made with one swap** (A swap exchanges the positions of two numbers `A[i]` and `A[j]`).  If it cannot be done, then return the same array.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]
Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: [1,1,5]
Output: [1,1,5]
Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: [1,9,4,6,7]
Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: [3,1,1,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3]
Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3.
``` 

### Note:
* `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
* `1 <= A[i] <= 10000`

            if (A[i - 1] > A[i]) {
                start = i - 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (start == -1) {
            return A;
        }
        int max = A[start];
        int exchange = start + 1;
        int min = A[exchange];
        while(exchange + 1 < len && A[exchange + 1] < max && A[exchange + 1] > min){
            exchange++;
        }
        A[start] = A[exchange];
        A[exchange] = max;
        return A;
    }
