# [1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap](https://leetcode.com/problems/previous-permutation-with-one-swap/)
---

> Given an array `A` of positive integers (not necessarily distinct), return the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than `A`, that can be **made with one swap** (A swap exchanges the positions of two numbers `A[i]` and `A[j]`).  If it cannot be done, then return the same array.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [3,2,1]
> Output: [3,1,2]
> Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [1,1,5]
> Output: [1,1,5]
> Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: [1,9,4,6,7]
> Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
> Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: [3,1,1,3]
> Output: [1,3,1,3]
> Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
> * `1 <= A[i] <= 10000`
