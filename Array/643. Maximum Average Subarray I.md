> Given an array consisting of `n` integers, find the contiguous subarray of given length `k` that has the maximum average value.
> And you need to output the maximum average value.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
> Output: 12.75
> Explanation: Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 30,000.
> * Elements of the given array will be in the range [-10,000, 10,000].
