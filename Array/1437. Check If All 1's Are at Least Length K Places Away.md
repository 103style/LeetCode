> Given an array `nums` of 0s and 1s and an integer `k`, return `True` if all 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `False`.

>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_1_1791.png)
>
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
> Output: true
> Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_2_1791.png)
>
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
> Output: false
> Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 0
> Output: true
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: nums = [0,1,0,1], k = 1
> Output: true
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
> * `0 <= k <= nums.length`
> * `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`
