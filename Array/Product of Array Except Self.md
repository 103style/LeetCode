# 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array of n integers where n > 1, `nums`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Solve it without division and in O(n).

For example, given `[1,2,3,4]`, return `[24,12,8,6]`.

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? 
(Note: The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
