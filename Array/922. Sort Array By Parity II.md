> **Related Topics** : **Array**、**Sort**

---

> Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.
>
> Sort the array so that whenever `A[i]` is odd, i is odd; and whenever `A[i]` is even, `i` is even.
>
> You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [4,2,5,7]
> Output: [4,5,2,7]
> Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `2 <= A.length <= 20000`
> * `A.length % 2 == 0`
> * `0 <= A[i] <= 1000`
