#  1122. [Relative Sort Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/)

Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`.  Elements that don't appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

### Constraints:
* `arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
* Each `arr2[i]` is distinct.
* Each `arr2[i]` is in `arr1`.

### Solution
