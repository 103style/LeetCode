> Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value **in-place** and return the new length.
>
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.
>
> The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
>
> Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
>
> It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
>
> Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
>
> Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
>
> It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> Clarification:
>
> Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
>
> Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
>
> Internally you can think of this:
> ```
> // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
> int len = removeElement(nums, val);
>
> // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
> // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
>     print(nums[i]);
> }
> ```

### Solution
* **java**
  * **mine** 
    
    `Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 38.1 MB, less than 5.05% of Java online submissions`
  
    same as [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://github.com/103style/LeetCode/blob/master/Array/26.%20Remove%20Duplicates%20from%20Sorted%20Array.md).
    ```
    //O(N)Time O(1)Space
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int i = 0;
        for(int n : nums){
            if(n != val){
                nums[i] = n;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
    ```
