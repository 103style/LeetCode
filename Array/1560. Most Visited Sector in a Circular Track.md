> Given an integer `n` and an integer array `rounds`. We have a circular track which consists of `n` sectors labeled from `1` to `n`. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of `m` rounds. The `ith` round starts at sector `rounds[i - 1]` and ends at sector `rounds[i]`. For example, round 1 starts at sector `rounds[0]` and ends at sector `rounds[1]`
>
> Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in **ascending** order.
>
> Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/14/tmp.jpg)
> ```
> Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
> Output: [1,2]
> Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
> 1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
> We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
> Output: [2]
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7]
> Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= n <= 100`
> * `1 <= m <= 100`
> * `rounds.length == m + 1`
> * `1 <= rounds[i] <= n`
> * `rounds[i] != rounds[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < m`

      ```
      // O(N)time
      // O(N)space
      public List<Integer> mostVisited(int n, int[] rounds) {
          List<Integer> res = new LinkedList<>();
          int l = rounds.length;
          if(rounds[l - 1] < rounds[0]){
              for(int i = 1; i <= rounds[l - 1]; i++){
                  res.add(i);
              }
              for(int i = rounds[0]; i <= n; i++){
                  res.add(i);
              }
              return res;
          }
          for(int i = rounds[0]; i <= rounds[l - 1];i++){
              res.add(i);
