# [950.Reveal Cards In Increasing Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/)
---

> In a deck of cards, every card has a unique integer.  You can order the deck in any order you want.
>
> Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.
>
> Now, you do the following steps repeatedly, until all cards are revealed:
>
> * Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
> * If there are still cards in the deck, put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
> * If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, stop.
>
> Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in **increasing order**.
>
> The first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
> Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
> Explanation:
> We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order doesn't matter), and reorder it.
> After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
> We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
> We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
> We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
> We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
> We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
> We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
> We reveal 17.
> Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * 1 <= A.length <= 1000
> * 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6
> * A[i] != A[j] for all i != j
