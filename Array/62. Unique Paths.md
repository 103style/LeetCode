  Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

### Note: 
* m and n will be at most 100.

### Example 1:
    Input: m = 3, n = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down
    2. Right -> Down -> Right
    3. Down -> Right -> Right

### Example 2:
    Input: m = 7, n = 3
    Output: 28
