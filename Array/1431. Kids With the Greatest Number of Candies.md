# [1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/)
---

> Given the array `candies` and the integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the **ith** kid has.
>
> For each kid check if there is a way to distribute `extraCandies` among the kids such that he or she can have the **greatest** number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
> Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
> Explanation:
> Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids.
> Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.
> Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids.
> Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies.
> Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
> Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
> Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
> Output: [true,false,true]
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= candies.length <= 100`
> * `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
> * `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`
