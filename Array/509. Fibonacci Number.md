# 509. [Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
```
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
```

Given `N`, calculate `F(N)`.

 

### Example 1:
    Input: 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

### Example 2:
    Input: 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

### Example 3:
    Input: 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
 

### Note:
* 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 30.
