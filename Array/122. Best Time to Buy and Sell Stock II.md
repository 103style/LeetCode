> Say you have an array `prices` for which the i<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day i.
> 
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
> 
> ### Note
> * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> Output: 7
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
>              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
> ``` 
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4`
> * `0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4`

### Solution
* **mine**  
  * **Java**
    ```
    // O(n) time  
    // O(1) space
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            res += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]);
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

* **other**
    ```
    // O(n^2)time
    // O(n)space
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        return calculate(prices, 0);
    }

    public int calculate(int prices[], int s) {
        if (s >= prices.length)
            return 0;
        int max = 0;
        for (int start = s; start < prices.length; start++) {
            int maxprofit = 0;
            for (int i = start + 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
                if (prices[start] < prices[i]) {
                    int profit = calculate(prices, i + 1) + prices[i] - prices[start];
                    if (profit > maxprofit)
                        maxprofit = profit;
                }
            }
            if (maxprofit > max)
                max = maxprofit;
        }
        return max;
    }
    ```
