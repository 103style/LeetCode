> Say you have an array for which the i<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day i.
> 
> If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
> 
> Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
>              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
> ```
