> Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of `A`, followed by all the odd elements of `A`.
>
> You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [3,1,2,4]
> Output: [2,4,3,1]
> The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `1 <= A.length <= 5000`
> * `0 <= A[i] <= 5000`

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * `Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 99.69%, Memory Usage: 40.5 MB, less than 54.94% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      //O(N)time
      //O(1)space
      public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] A) {
          int i = 0;
          for(int j = 0; j < A.length; j++){
              if(A[j] % 2 == 0){
                  swap(A, i, j);
                  i++;
              }
          }
          return A;
      }

      void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j){
          if(i == j) return;
          int t = arr[i];
          arr[i] = arr[j];
          arr[j] = t;
      }
      ```
