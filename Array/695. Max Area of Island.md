# [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/description/)
---

> Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and `1's`, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
>
> Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
> ```
> Given the above grid, return `6`. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
>
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
> ```
> Given the above grid, return `0`.
>
> ### Note:
> * The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.
