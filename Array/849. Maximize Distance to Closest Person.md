> You are given an array representing a row of `seats` where `seats[i] = 1` represents a person sitting in the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> seat, and `seats[i] = 0` represents that the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> seat is empty (**0-indexed**).
> 
> There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.
> 
> Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.
> 
> Return that maximum distance to the closest person.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/distance.jpg)
> ```
> Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
> Output: 2
> Explanation:
> If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
> If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
> Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: seats = [1,0,0,0]
> Output: 3
> Explanation:
> If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats[3]), the closest person is 3 seats away.
> This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: seats = [0,1]
> Output: 1
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= seats.length <= 2 * 10^4`
> * `seats[i]` is `0` or `1`.
> * At least one seat is **empty**.
> * At least one seat is **occupied**.
