**leetcode-cn Daily Challenge on June 24, 2020.**

---

> Given an array `nums` of n integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
>
> The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
> ```
