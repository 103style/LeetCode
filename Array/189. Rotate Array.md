# 189. [Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/)

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

### Example 1:
    Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
    Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
    Explanation:
    rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
    rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
    rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
### Example 2:
    Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
    Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
    Explanation: 
    rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
    rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
### Note:
* Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
* Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

### Solution
* **mine**
```
// O(n*k)time  O(1)space   `Time Limit Exceeded`
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        if(k == 0 || nums == null || nums.length == 0){
            return;
        }
        int temp = 0;
        int size = nums.length;
        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
            temp = nums[size - 1];
            for(int j = size - 1; j > 0; j--){
               nums[j] = nums[j - 1];
            }
            nums[0] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```
