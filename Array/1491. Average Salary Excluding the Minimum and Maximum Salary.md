---

**the first one in Biweekly Contest 29.**

---

> Given an array of **unique** integers `salary` where `salary[i]` is the salary of the employee `i`.
>
> Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
> Output: 2500.00000
> Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
> Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000)/2= 2500
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]
> Output: 2000.00000
> Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
> Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000)/1= 2000
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: salary = [6000,5000,4000,3000,2000,1000]
> Output: 3500.00000
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: salary = [8000,9000,2000,3000,6000,1000]
> Output: 4750.00000
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `3 <= salary.length <= 100`
> * `10^3 <= salary[i] <= 10^6`
> * `salary[i]` is unique.
> * Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * **Arrays.sort** `Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 36.7 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(N*logN)time O(N)space
      public double average(int[] salary) {
          Arrays.sort(salary);
          double res = 0D;
          for(int i = 1; i < salary.length - 1; i++){
              res += salary[i];
          }
          return res / (salary.length - 2);
      }
      ```
