# [1471. The k Strongest Values in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-strongest-values-in-an-array/)
---

> Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.
>
> A value arr[i] is said to be stronger than a value `arr[j]` if `|arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m|` where `m` is the **median** of the array.
> If `|arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|`, then `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than `arr[j]` if `arr[i] > arr[j]`.
>
> Return a list of the strongest `k` values in the array. return the answer **in any arbitrary order**.
>
> **Median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position `((n - 1) / 2)` in the sorted list **(0-indexed)**.
> * For `arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11], n = 5` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2`. The median is `6`.
> * For `arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3], n = 4` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22]` and the median is arr[m] where `m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1`. The median is `3`.

>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
> Output: [5,1]
> Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also accepted answer.
> Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2
> Output: [5,5]
> Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: arr = [6,7,11,7,6,8], k = 5
> Output: [11,8,6,6,7]
> Explanation: Median is 7, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [11,8,6,6,7,7].
> Any permutation of [11,8,6,6,7] is accepted.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: arr = [6,-3,7,2,11], k = 3
> Output: [-3,11,2]
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: arr = [-7,22,17,3], k = 2
> Output: [22,17]
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
> * `-10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= k <= arr.length`
