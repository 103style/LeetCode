> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
> Output: false
> Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
> ```

> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
> Output: true
> Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
> * `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
