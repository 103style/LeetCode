# [1450. Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-doing-homework-at-a-given-time/)

Given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime` and given an integer `queryTime`.

The `ith` student started doing their homework at the time `startTime[i]` and finished it at time `endTime[i]`.

Return the number of students doing their homework at time `queryTime`. More formally, return the number of students where `queryTime` lays in the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]` inclusive.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: We have 3 students where:
The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 5
Output: 0
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: startTime = [1,1,1,1], endTime = [1,3,2,4], queryTime = 7
Output: 0
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: startTime = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], endTime = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], queryTime = 5
Output: 5
```

### Constraints:
* `startTime.length == endTime.length`
* `1 <= startTime.length <= 100`
* `1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= queryTime <= 1000`

        for(int i = 0; i < startTime.length; i++){
            if(startTime[i]<=queryTime && endTime[i]>=queryTime){
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```
