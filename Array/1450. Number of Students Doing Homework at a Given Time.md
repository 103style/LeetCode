# [1450. Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-doing-homework-at-a-given-time/)
---

> Given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime` and given an integer `queryTime`.
>
> The `ith` student started doing their homework at the time `startTime[i]` and finished it at time `endTime[i]`.
>
> Return the number of students doing their homework at time `queryTime`. More formally, return the number of students where `queryTime` lays in the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]` inclusive.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
> Output: 1
> Explanation: We have 3 students where:
> The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
> The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
> The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 5
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: startTime = [1,1,1,1], endTime = [1,3,2,4], queryTime = 7
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: startTime = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], endTime = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], queryTime = 5
> Output: 5
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `startTime.length == endTime.length`
> * `1 <= startTime.length <= 100`
> * `1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000`
> * `1 <= queryTime <= 1000`
