> Given an array of positive integers `arr`,  find a pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times.
>
> A **pattern** is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times **consecutively** without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.
>
> Return `true` if there exists a pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times, otherwise return `false`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3
> Output: true
> Explanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2
> Output: true
> Explanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. Another valid pattern (2,1) is also repeated 2 times.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3
> Output: false
> Explanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,3,1,2], m = 2, k = 2
> Output: false
> Explanation: Notice that the pattern (1,2) exists twice but not consecutively, so it doesn't count.
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: arr = [2,2,2,2], m = 2, k = 3
> Output: false
> Explanation: The only pattern of length 2 is (2,2) however it's repeated only twice. Notice that we do not count overlapping repetitions.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= arr.length <= 100`
> * `1 <= arr[i] <= 100`
> * `1 <= m <= 100`
> * `2 <= k <= 100`
