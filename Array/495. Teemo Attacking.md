> In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking **ascending** time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.
> You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [1,4], 2
> Output: 4
> Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately.
> This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2.
> And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds.
> So you finally need to output 4.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [1,2], 2
> Output: 3
> Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned.
> This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2.
> However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status.
> Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3.
> So you finally need to output 3.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.
> * You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.

### Solution
* **mine**  
  * **Java**
    * `Your runtime beats 99.59 % of java submissions.`
      ```
      // O(N)time 
      // O(1)space
      public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
          if(timeSeries == null || timeSeries.length == 0 || duration == 0){
              return 0;
          }

          int res = 0, start = 0;
          int temp = 0;
          for(int i = 1; i < timeSeries.length; i++){
              start = i;
              //计算 两次攻击之间的时间间隔
              temp = timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i - 1];
              //间隔大于duration 中毒时间就是duration 否则就是攻击的时间间隔
              res +=  (temp > duration ? duration : temp);
          }
          //添加最后一击的时间
          res += duration;
          return res;
      }
      ```
