> A string is a **valid parentheses string** (denoted **VPS**) if it meets one of the following:
> * It is an empty string `""`, or a single character not equal to `"("` or `")"`,
> * It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are **VPS**'s, or
> * It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a **VPS**.
>
> We can similarly define the **nesting depth** `depth(S)` of any VPS `S` as follows:
> * `depth("") = 0`
> * `depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))`, where `A` and `B` are **VPS**'s
> * `depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A)`, where `A` is a **VPS**.
>
> For example, `""`, `"()()"`, and `"()(()())"` are **VPS**'s (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and `")("` and `"(()"` are not **VPS**'s.
>
> Given a **VPS** represented as string `s`, return the **nesting depth** of `s`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: s = "1+(2*3)/(2-1)"
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: s = "1"
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
> * s consists of digits `0-9` and characters `'+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'`.
> * It is guaranteed that parentheses expression `s` is a **VPS**.
