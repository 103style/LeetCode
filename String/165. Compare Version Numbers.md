> Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
> If `version1 > version2` return `1`; if `version1 < version2` return `-1`;otherwise return `0`.
>
> You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character.
>
> The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.
>
> For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.
>
> You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be `0`. For example, version number `3.4` has a revision number of `3` and `4` for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both `0`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
> Output: -1
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
> Output: -1
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots `.` and this numeric strings **may** have leading zeroes.
> * Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.
