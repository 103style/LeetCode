> Input: "the sky is blue"
> Output: "blue is sky the"
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: "  hello world!  "
> Output: "world! hello"
> Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: "a good   example"
> Output: "example good a"
> Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
> ```
> 
> ### Note:
> * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
> * Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> * You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
> 
> 
> ### Follow up:
> * For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) extra space.
