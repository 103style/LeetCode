> There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `0` to `n-1`, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially all the bulbs are **turned off**.
>
> Your task is to obtain the configuration represented by `target` where `target[i]` is '1' if the i-th bulb is turned on and is '0' if it is turned off.
>
> You have a switch to flip the state of the bulb, a flip operation is defined as follows:
> * Choose **any** bulb (index `i`) of your current configuration.
> * Flip each bulb from index `i` to `n-1`.
>
> When any bulb is flipped it means that if it is 0 it changes to 1 and if it is 1 it changes to 0.
>
> Return the **minimum** number of flips required to form target.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: target = "10111"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Initial configuration "00000".
> flip from the third bulb:  "00000" -> "00111"
> flip from the first bulb:  "00111" -> "11000"
> flip from the second bulb:  "11000" -> "10111"
> We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: target = "101"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: "000" -> "111" -> "100" -> "101".
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: target = "00000"
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: target = "001011101"
> Output: 5
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`
> * `target[i] == '0' or target[i] == '1'`
