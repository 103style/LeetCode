> Given two strings `A` and `B` of lowercase letters, return `true` if you can swap two letters in `A` so the result is equal to `B`, otherwise, return `false`.
>
> Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `A[i]` and `A[j]`.
> For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: A = "ab", B = "ba"
> Output: true
> Explanation: You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to B.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: A = "ab", B = "ab"
> Output: false
> Explanation: The only letters you can swap are A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != B.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: A = "aa", B = "aa"
> Output: true
> Explanation: You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to B.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: A = "aaaaaaabc", B = "aaaaaaacb"
> Output: true
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: A = "", B = "aa"
> Output: false
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `0 <= A.length <= 20000`
> * `0 <= B.length <= 20000`
> * `A` and `B` consist of lowercase letters.
