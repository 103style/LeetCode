###  [890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/)

You have a list of `words` and a `pattern`, and you want to know which `words` in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in `words` that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.


### Example 1:
    Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
    Output: ["mee","aqq"]
    Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
    "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
    since a and b map to the same letter.
 

### Note:
* 1 <= words.length <= 50
* 1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20
