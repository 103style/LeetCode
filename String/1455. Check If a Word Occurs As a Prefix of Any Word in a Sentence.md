# [1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-word-occurs-as-a-prefix-of-any-word-in-a-sentence/)

Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a **single space**, and a `searchWord`.

You have to check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

Return the index of the word in `sentence` where `searchWord` is a prefix of this word (**1-indexed**).

If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word **(minimum index)**. If there is no such word return **-1**.

A **prefix** of a string S is any leading contiguous substring of `S`.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
Output: 2
Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
Output: -1
Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: sentence = "i use triple pillow", searchWord = "pill"
Output: 4
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: sentence = "hello from the other side", searchWord = "they"
Output: -1
```

### Constraints:
* `1 <= sentence.length <= 100`
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 10`
* `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
* `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
