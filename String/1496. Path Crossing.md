# [1496. Path Crossing](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-crossing/)

---

**the first one in Weekly Contest 195**

---

Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `True` if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you've previously visited. Return `False` otherwise.

 

### Example 1:
![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123929-pm.png)
```
Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
```

### Example 2:
![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123843-pm.png)
```
Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
``` 

### Constraints:
* `1 <= path.length <= 10^4`
* `path` will only consist of characters in `{'N', 'S', 'E', 'W}`

      // O(N)time O(N)space
      // N = path.length()
      public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
          HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
          set.add("0,0");
          int x = 0, y = 0;
          char[] arr = path.toCharArray();
          for(char c : arr){
              if(c == 'N' || c == 'S'){
                  y += c == 'N' ? 1 : -1;
              }else{
                  x += c == 'E' ? 1 : -1;
              }
              String t = x + "," + y;
              if(set.contains(t)){
                  return true;
              }else{
                  set.add(t);
              }
          }
          return false;
      }
