> Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
> 
> Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: "00110011"
> Output: 6
> Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
> 
> Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
> 
> Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: "10101"
> Output: 4
> Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
> ```
> 
> ### Note:
> * `s.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.
> * `s` will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.
