> Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.
> 
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with **O(1)** extra memory.
> 
> You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
> 
>  
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
> Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
> Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
> ```
