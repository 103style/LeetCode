# [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with **O(1)** extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
