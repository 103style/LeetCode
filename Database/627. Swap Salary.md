# [627. Swap Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-salary/)
---

> **SQL Schema>**
>
> Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a **single update statement** and no intermediate temp table.
>
> Note that you must write a single update statement, **DO NOT** write any select statement for this problem.
>
>
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> | id | name | sex | salary |
> |----|------|-----|--------|
> | 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
> | 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
> | 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
> | 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
> ```
>
> After running your **update** statement, the above salary table should have the following rows:
> ```
> | id | name | sex | salary |
> |----|------|-----|--------|
> | 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
> | 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
> | 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
> | 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
> ```
