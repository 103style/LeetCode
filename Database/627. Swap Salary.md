# [627. Swap Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-salary/)

**SQL Schema>**

Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a **single update statement** and no intermediate temp table.

Note that you must write a single update statement, **DO NOT** write any select statement for this problem.

 

### Example:
```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
```

After running your **update** statement, the above salary table should have the following rows:
```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```
