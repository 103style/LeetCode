> There is an infrastructure of `n` cities with some number of `roads` connecting these cities. Each `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `ai` and `bi`.
>
> The **network rank** of **two different cities** is defined as the total number of **directly** connected roads to **either** city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted **once**.
>
> The **maximal network rank** of the infrastructure is the **maximum network rank** of all pairs of different cities.
>
> Given the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return the **maximal network rank** of the entire infrastructure.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/ex1.png)
>
> ```
> Input: n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/ex2.png)
>
> ```
> Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.
> ```
>
> ## Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 8, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[5,6],[5,7]]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: The network rank of 2 and 5 is 5. Notice that all the cities do not have to be connected.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= n <= 100`
> * `0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
> * `roads[i].length == 2`
> * `0 <= ai, bi <= n-1`
> * `ai != bi`
> * Each pair of cities has **at most one** road connecting them.
