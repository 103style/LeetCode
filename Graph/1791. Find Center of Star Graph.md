> There is an undirected **star** graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`.
> A star graph is a graph where there is one **center** node and **exactly** `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.
>
> You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`.
> Return the center of the given star graph.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/24/star_graph.png)
> ```
> Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `3 <= n <= 10^5`
> * `edges.length == n - 1`
> * `edges[i].length == 2`
> * `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
> * `ui != vi`
> * The given `edges` represent a valid star graph.
