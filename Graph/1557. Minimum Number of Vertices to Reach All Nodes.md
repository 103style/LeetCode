> Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from`<sub>`i`</sub>`, to`<sub>`i`</sub>`]` represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.
>
> Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.
>
> Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled22.png)
> ```
> Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
> Output: [0,3]
> Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled.png)
> ```
> Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
> Output: [0,2,3]
> Explanation: Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= n <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
> * `edges[i].length == 2`
> * `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
> * All pairs (`from`<sub>`i`</sub>`, to`<sub>`i`</sub>) are distinct.
