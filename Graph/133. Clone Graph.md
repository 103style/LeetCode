> Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph.
>
> Return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.
>
> Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.
> ```
> class Node {
>     public int val;
>     public List<Node> neighbors;
> }
> ```
>
> **Test case format:**
>
> For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val = 1`, the second node with `val = 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
>
> **Adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
>
> The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.
>

> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)
> ```
> Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
> Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
> Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
> 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
> 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
> 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
> 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)
> ```
> Input: adjList = [[]]
> Output: [[]]
> Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: adjList = []
> Output: []
> Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ![4](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)
> ```
> Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
> Output: [[2],[1]]
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
> * Node.val is unique for each node.
> * Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
> * There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
> * The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * **DFS** `Runtime: 26 ms, faster than 97.42%, Memory Usage: 39.9 MB, less than 50.09% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(N)time
      // O(N)space
      HashMap<Integer,Node> cache = new HashMap<>();

      public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
          if(node == null) return node;
          dfs(node);
          return cache.get(node.val);
      }


      void dfs(Node node){
          if(cache.containsKey(node.val)){
              return;
          }
          Node copy = new Node(node.val);
          cache.put(node.val, copy);
          for(Node n : node.neighbors){
              dfs(n);
              copy.neighbors.add(cache.get(n.val));
          }
      }
      ```
