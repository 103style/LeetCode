> **Difficulty** : **Medium**

> **Related Topics** : **Binary Search Tree**

---

> Given the root of a binary **search** tree with distinct values, modify it so that every `node` has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to `node.val`.
>
> As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
> * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
> * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
> * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
>
>
> ### Example 1:

> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/02/tree.png)
> ```
> Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
> Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `100`.
> * Each node will have value between `0` and `100`.
> * The given tree is a binary search tree.
