# [1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/)

Given the root of a binary **search** tree with distinct values, modify it so that every node has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to node.val.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

### Example 1:
![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/02/tree.png)

```
Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

### Note:
* The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 100.
* Each node will have value between 0 and 100.
* The given tree is a binary search tree.

        pre = root.val = pre + root.val;
        if (root.left != null) {
            bstToGst(root.left);
        }
