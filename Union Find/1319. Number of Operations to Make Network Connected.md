> There are n computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between computers `a` and `b`.
> Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.
> 
> Given an initial computer network `connections`.
> You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.
> Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it's not possible, return `-1`.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample_1_1677.png)
> ```
> Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample_2_1677.png)
> ```
> Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
> Output: 2
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
> Output: -1
> Explanation: There are not enough cables.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: n = 5, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
> Output: 0
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= n <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= connections.length <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 10^5)`
> * `connections[i].length == 2`
> * `0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] < n`
> * `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
> * There are no repeated connections.
> * No two computers are connected by more than one cable.
