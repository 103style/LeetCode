# [547. Friend Circles](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/)

---

> **Difficulty** : **Medium**
>
> **Related Topics** : **DFS**、**Union Find**

---


> There are **N** students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature.
> For example, if A is a **direct** friend of B, and B is a **direct** friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.
>
> Given a **N*N** matrix **M** representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the i<sub>th<sub> and j<sub>th<sub> students are **direct** friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input:
> [[1,1,0],
>  [1,1,0],
>  [0,0,1]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle.
> The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input:
> [[1,1,0],
>  [1,1,1],
>  [0,1,1]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends,
> so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.

> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= N <= 200`
> * `M[i][i] == 1`
> * `M[i][j] == M[j][i]`
