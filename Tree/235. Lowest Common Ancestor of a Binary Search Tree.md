> Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
>
> According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
>
> Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
> Output: 6
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
> * p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
