### [814. Binary Tree Pruning](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/)

We are given the head node `root` of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

### Example 1:
    Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
    Output: [1,null,0,null,1]

    Explanation: 
    Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
    The diagram on the right represents the answer.

### Note:
* The binary tree will have at most `100 nodes`.
* The value of each node will only be `0` or `1`.
