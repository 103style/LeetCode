> Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST.
> Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.
>
> Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.
>
> For example,
> ```
> Given the tree:
>         4
>        / \
>       2   7
>      / \
>     1   3
> And the value to insert: 5
> ```
> You can return this binary search tree:
> ```
>          4
>        /   \
>       2     7
>      / \   /
>     1   3 5
> ```
> This tree is also valid:
> ```
>          5
>        /   \
>       2     7
>      / \
>     1   3
>          \
>           4
> ```

> ### Constraints:
> * The number of nodes in the given tree will be between `0` and `10^4`.
> * Each node will have a unique integer value from `0` to `-10^8`, inclusive.
> * `-10^8 <= val <= 10^8`
> * It's guaranteed that `val` does not exist in the original BST.
