Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

### Example:
```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

      public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
          return buildTree(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
      }

      TreeNode buildTree(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
          if (start > end) {
              return null;
          }
          if (end == start) {
              return new TreeNode(nums[start]);
          }
          int mid = (end + start + 1) >> 1;
          TreeNode node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
          node.left = buildTree(nums, start, mid - 1);
          node.right = buildTree(nums, mid + 1, end);
          return node;
      }
