> Given a binary tree, each node has value `0` or `1`.
> Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.
> For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.
>
> For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.
>
> Return the sum of these numbers.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/04/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers.png)
> ```
> Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
> Output: 22
> Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `1000`.
> * node.val is `0` or `1`.
> * The answer will not exceed `2^31 - 1`.
