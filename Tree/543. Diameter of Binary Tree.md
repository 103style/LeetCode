> Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
> 
> ### Example:
> Given a binary tree
> ```
>           1
>          / \
>         2   3
>        / \
>       4   5
> ```
> Return **3**, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
> 
> 
> ### Note
> * The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

    * **DFS** `Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 41.3 MB, less than 5.03% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      int res = 0;
      public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
          if(root != null) dfs(root);
          return res;
      }

      int dfs(TreeNode node){
          if(node.left == null && node.right == null){
              return 0;
          }
          int left = node.left != null ? dfs(node.left) + 1: 0;
          int right = node.right != null ? dfs(node.right) + 1 : 0;
          res = Math.max(res, left + right);
          return Math.max(left, right);
      }
      ```
