# [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
``` 

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
``` 

### Follow up
Solve it both recursively and iteratively.

    }
    
    public boolean check(TreeNode left,TreeNode right){
        if(left == null && right == null){
            return true;

        if(left == null || right == null){
            return false;
        }
        return left.val == right.val && check(left.left,right.right) && check(left.right,right.left); 
    }
    ```
