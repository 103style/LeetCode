> Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: The root of a Binary Search Tree like this:
>               5
>             /   \
>            2     13
>
> Output: The root of a Greater Tree like this:
>              18
>             /   \
>           20     13
> ```
