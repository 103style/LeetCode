# [771. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

### Example 1:
    Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
    Output: 3
    
### Example 2:
    Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
    Output: 0
    
### Note:
* S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in J are distinct.

```
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i < J.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 0;j < S.length(); j++){
                if(J.charAt(i) == S.charAt(j)){
                    res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
