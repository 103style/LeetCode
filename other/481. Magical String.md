> A magical string **S** consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:
>
> The string **S** is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string **S** itself.
>
> The first few elements of string **S** is the following: **S** = "1221121221221121122……"
>
> If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:
>
> 1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......
>
> and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:
>
> 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......
>
> You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the **S** itself.
>
> Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.
>
> ### Note
> * N will not exceed 100,000.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: 6
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string **S** is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
