> The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that **"all houses in this place forms a binary tree"**. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
>
> Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
>
>      3
>     / \
>    2   3
>     \   \
>      3   1
>
> Output: 7
> Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
>
>      3
>     / \
>    4   5
>   / \   \
>  1   3   1
>
> Output: 9
> Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

    * **DFS** `Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 75.31%, Memory Usage: 41.8 MB, less than 5.03% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(N)time
      // O(D)space  D is the depth of root
      public int rob(TreeNode root) {
          int[] res = dfs(root);
          return Math.max(res[0], res[1]);
      }

      int[] dfs(TreeNode node){
          if(node == null){
              return new int[]{0, 0};
          }
          int[] left = dfs(node.left);
          int[] right = dfs(node.right);
          int[] res = new int[2];
          res[0] = left[1] +  node.val + right[1];
          res[1] = Math.max(left[0], left[1]) + Math.max(right[0], right[1]);
          return res;
      }
      ```
