> Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `V` for which there exists **different** nodes `A` and `B` where `V = |A.val - B.val|` and `A` is an ancestor of `B`.
>
> (A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:

> ![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/09/2whqcep.jpg)
> ```
> Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
> Output: 7
> Explanation:
> We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
> |8 - 3| = 5
> |3 - 7| = 4
> |8 - 1| = 7
> |10 - 13| = 3
> Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/09/tmp-tree-1.jpg)
> ```
> Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
> Output: 3
> ```
> 
> ### Note:
> * The number of nodes in the tree is between `2` and `5000`.
> * Each node will have value between `0` and `100000`.
