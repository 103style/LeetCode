# [559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/)

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

 
### Example 1:
![Example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:
![Example2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: 5
``` 

### Constraints:
* The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.
* The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`.

        if(root == null){
            return 0;
        }
        int res = 1;
        List<Node> children = root.children;
        int t = 0;
        for(Node node : children){
            t = Math.max(t, dfs(node));
        }
        return res + t;
    }
    ```
