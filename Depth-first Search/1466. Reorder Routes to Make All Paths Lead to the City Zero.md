# [1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/)
---

> There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.
>
> Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a road from city `a` to `b`.
>
> This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.
>
> Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.
>
> It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach the city 0 after reorder.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
>
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_1_1819.png)
> ```
> Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_2_1819.png)
> ```
> Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
> * `connections.length == n-1`
> * `connections[i].length == 2`
> * `0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= n-1`
> * `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`

      int res = 0;
      int[] t = new int[n];
      t[0] = 1;
      for(int[] c : connections){
        if(t[c[1]] == 0){
          res++;
        }
        t[c[0]] = 1;
        t[c[1]] = 1;
      }
      return res;
    }
    ```
    **pass all the leetcode test case, but not correct if test case like:**
    ```
    3
    [[1,2],[2,0]]

    6
    [[2,3],[3,1],[1,0],[4,0],[4,5]]

    3
    [[2,1],[0,2]]
    ```
