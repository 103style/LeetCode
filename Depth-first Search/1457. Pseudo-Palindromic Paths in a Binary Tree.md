# [1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be **pseudo-palindromic** if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of ***pseudo-palindromic*** paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

 
### Example 1:
![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/06/palindromic_paths_1.png)
```
Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

### Example 2:
![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/palindromic_paths_2.png)
```
Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [9]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:
* The given binary tree will have between `1` and `10^5` nodes.
* Node values are digits from `1` to `9`.
