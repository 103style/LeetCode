> Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
>
> The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
>
> **Note**: A leaf is a node with no children.
>
> ### Example:
>
> Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,
> ```
>     3
>    / \
>   9  20
>     /  \
>    15   7
> ```
> return its depth = 3.

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * **DFS** `Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 39.3 MB, less than 93.55% of Java online submissions `
      ```
      public int max = 0;
      public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
          dfs(root, 0);
          return max;
      }

      public void dfs(TreeNode node, int depth){
          if(node == null){
              return;
          }
          int d = depth + 1;
          max = Math.max(d, max);
          dfs(node.left, d);
          dfs(node.right, d);
      }
      ```
