# [979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/)
---

> Given the `root` of a binary tree with `N` nodes, each `node` in the tree has `node.val` coins, and there are `N` coins total.
>
> In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)
>
> Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![Example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree1.png)
> ```
> Input: [3,0,0]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![Example2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png)
>
> ```
> Input: [0,3,0]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves].  Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ![Example3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree3.png)
>
> ```
> Input: [1,0,2]
> Output: 2
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ![Example4](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree4.png)
> ```
> Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
> Output: 4
> ```

> ### Note:
> * `1<= N <= 100`
> * `0 <= node.val <= N`
