> You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length. You want to change `s` to `t`.
> Changing the `i`-th character of `s` to `i`-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.
>
> You are also given an integer `maxCost`.
>
> Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.
>
> If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
> Output: 3
> Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
> Output: 1
> Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
> Output: 1
> Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
> * `0 <= maxCost <= 10^6`
> * `s` and `t` only contain lower case English letters.

      public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
          int len = s.length();
          int[] count = new int[len];
          for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
              count[i] = Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - t.charAt(i));
          }
          int left = 0;

          int cost = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
              cost += count[i];
              while (cost > maxCost && left <= i) {
                  cost -= count[left];
                  left++;
              }
              ans = Math.max(ans, i - left + 1);
          }
          return ans;
      }
