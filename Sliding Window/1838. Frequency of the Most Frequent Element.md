> The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.
>
> You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.
> In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.
>
> Return the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most** `k` operations.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
> 4 has a frequency of 3.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
> Output: 2
> Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
> - Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
> - Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
> - Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= k <= 10^5`
