# [1453. Maximum Number of Darts Inside of a Circular Dartboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-darts-inside-of-a-circular-dartboard/)
---

> You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of `points` on a 2D plane.
>
> Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on **any** circular dartboard of radius `r`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/29/sample_1_1806.png)
> ```
> Input: points = [[-2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[0,-2]], r = 2
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Circle dartboard with center in (0,0) and radius = 2 contain all points.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
>
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/29/sample_2_1806.png)
>
> ```
> Input: points = [[-3,0],[3,0],[2,6],[5,4],[0,9],[7,8]], r = 5
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Circle dartboard with center in (0,4) and radius = 5 contain all points except the point (7,8).
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: points = [[-2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[0,-2]], r = 1
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: points = [[1,2],[3,5],[1,-1],[2,3],[4,1],[1,3]], r = 2
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= points.length <= 100`
> * `points[i].length == 2`
> * `-10^4 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^4`
> * `1 <= r <= 5000`
