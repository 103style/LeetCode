# [523. Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)

Given a list of **non-negative** numbers and a target **integer** k, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to a multiple of **k**, that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an **integer**.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
```

### Note:
* The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
* You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer.

      for (int i=0;i<nums.length;i++) {
          runningSum += nums[i];
          if (k != 0) runningSum %= k; 
          Integer prev = map.get(runningSum);
          if (prev != null) {
              if (i - prev > 1) return true;
          }
