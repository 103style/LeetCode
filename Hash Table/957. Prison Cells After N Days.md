# [957. Prison Cells After N Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/)

**Difficulty** : **Medium**

---

**leetcode Daily Challenge on July 3rd, 2020.**

---

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:
* If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
* Otherwise, it becomes vacant.


(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: `cells[i] == 1` if the i-th cell is occupied, else `cells[i] == 0`.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after `N` days (and `N` such changes described above.)

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```


### Example 2:
```
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
``` 

### Note:
* `cells.length == 8`
* `cells[i]` is in `{0, 1}`
* `1 <= N <= 10^9`
