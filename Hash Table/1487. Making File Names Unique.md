> Given an array of strings `names` of size `n`. You will create `n` folders in your file system **such that**, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name `names[i]`.
>
> Since two files **cannot** have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of `(k)`, where, k is the **smallest positive integer** such that the obtained name remains unique.
>
> Return an array of strings of length `n` where `ans[i]` is the actual name the system will assign to the `ith` folder when you create it.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
> Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
> Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
> "pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
> "fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
> "gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
> "pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
> Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
> Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
> "gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
> "gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
> "gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
> "avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
> Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
> Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes "onepiece(4)".
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: names = ["wano","wano","wano","wano"]
> Output: ["wano","wano(1)","wano(2)","wano(3)"]
> Explanation: Just increase the value of k each time you create folder "wano".
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: names = ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido","kaido(1)"]
> Output: ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido(2)","kaido(1)(1)"]
> Explanation: Please note that system adds the suffix (k) to current name even it contained the same suffix before.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10^4`
> * `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
> * `names[i]` consists of lower case English letters, digits and/or round brackets.
