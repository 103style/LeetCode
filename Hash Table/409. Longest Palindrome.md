> Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
>
> This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.
>
> ### Note:
> Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input:
> "abccccdd"
>
> Output:
> 7
>
> Explanation:
> One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
