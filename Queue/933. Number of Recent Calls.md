> You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.
>
> Implement the `RecentCounter` class:
> * `RecentCounter()` Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
> * `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that has happened in the past `3000` milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`.
>
>
> It is **guaranteed** that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than the previous call.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input
> ["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
> [[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
> Output
> [null, 1, 2, 3, 3]
>
> Explanation
> RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
> recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [1], range is [-2999,1], return 1
> recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900,100], return 2
> recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1,3001], return 3
> recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2,3002], return 3
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= t <= 10^4`
> * Each test case will call `ping` with **strictly increasing** values of `t`.
> * At most `10^4` calls will be made to ping.

      LinkedList<Integer> list;
      public RecentCounter() {
          list = new LinkedList<>();
      }

      public int ping(int t) {
          list.add(t);
          while(!list.isEmpty() && t - 3000 > list.getFirst()){
              list.removeFirst();
          }
          return list.size();
      }
