# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

### Example:
```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

### Note:
* There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
* Your algorithm should run in `O(n2)` complexity.

### Follow up
Could you improve it to `O(n log n)` time complexity?


### Solution
