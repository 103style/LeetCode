> Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
>
> According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have **at least** h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have **no more than** h citations each."
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
>              received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
>              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
>              two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
>
> ### Follow up:
> * This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
* Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

      // O(logN)time O(1)space
      public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
          int len = citations.length;;
          int s = 0, e = len;
          while (s < e) {
              int m = (s + e) / 2;
              if (citations[m] >= len - m) {
                  e = m;
              } else {
                  s = m + 1;
              }
          }
          return len - s;
      }
