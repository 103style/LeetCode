> Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
>
> (i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).
>
> You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
> Output: true
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
> Output: false
> ```
>
> ### Follow up:
> * This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where `nums` may contain duplicates.
> * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
