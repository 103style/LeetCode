> In universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.
> 
> Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.
> 
> Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return the required force.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/11/q3v1.jpg)
> ```
> Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
> Output: 999999999
> Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `n == position.length`
> * `2 <= n <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`
> * All integers in `position` are **distinct**.
> * `2 <= m <= position.length`
