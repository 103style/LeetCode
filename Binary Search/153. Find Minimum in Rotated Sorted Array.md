> Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
>
> (i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).
>
> Find the minimum element.
>
> You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [1,3,5]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
> Output: 0
> ```

      public int findMin(int[] nums) {
          int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
          while(l < r){
              int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
              if(nums[mid] < nums[r]){
                  r = mid;
              }else{
                  l = mid + 1;
