> Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`,
> trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`.
> Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant).
> It can be proven that there is a **unique answer**.
> 
> Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim1.jpg)
> ```
> Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
> Output: [1,null,2]
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim2.jpg)
> ```
> Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
> Output: [3,2,null,1]
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: root = [1], low = 1, high = 2
> Output: [1]
> ```
> 
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: root = [1,null,2], low = 1, high = 3
> Output: [1,null,2]
> ```
> 
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: root = [1,null,2], low = 2, high = 4
> Output: [2]
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * The number of nodes in the tree in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
> * `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
> * The value of each node in the tree is **unique**.
> * `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
> * `0 <= low <= high <= 10^4`

          root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, root.val);
          root.right = trimBST(root.right, root.val, high);
