> There is a **hidden** integer array `arr` that consists of `n` non-negative integers.
> 
> It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, such that `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`. 
> For example, if `arr = [1,0,2,1]`, then `encoded = [1,2,3]`.
> 
> You are given the `encoded` array. You are also given an integer `first`, that is the first element of `arr`, i.e. `arr[0]`.
> 
> Return the original array `arr`. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.
> 
>  
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1
> Output: [1,0,2,1]
> Explanation: If arr = [1,0,2,1], then first = 1 and encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1,2,3]
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4
> Output: [4,2,0,7,4]
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= n <= 10^4`
> * `encoded.length == n - 1`
> * `0 <= encoded[i] <= 10^5`
> * `0 <= first <= 10^5`

      public int[] decode(int[] encoded, int first) {
          int len = encoded.length;
          int[] res = new int[len + 1];
          res[0] = first;
          for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
              res[i + 1] = res[i] ^ encoded[i];
          }
          return res;
      }    
      ```
