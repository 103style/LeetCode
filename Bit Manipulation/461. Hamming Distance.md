> The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
>
> Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
>
> ### Note:
> * 0 ≤ x, y < 231.
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: x = 1, y = 4
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation:
> 1   (0 0 0 1)
> 4   (0 1 0 0)
>        ↑   ↑
>
> The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
