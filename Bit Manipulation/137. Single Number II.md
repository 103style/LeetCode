> Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
>
> ### Note:
> Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [2,2,3,2]
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
> Output: 99
> ```

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * count every bit value of `1`, if `count % 3 != 0`, the res in this bit is `1`.
