> Given a **non-empty** array of numbers, a0, a1, a2, … , an-1, where 0 ≤ ai < 2<sup>31</sup>.
>
> Find the maximum result of ai XOR aj, where 0 ≤ i, j < n.
>
> Could you do this in O(n) runtime?
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]
>
> Output: 28
>
> Explanation: The maximum result is 5 ^ 25 = 28.
