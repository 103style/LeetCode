# [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a `non-empty` array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

### Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Example 1:
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

### Solution

  ```
  //O(N)time O(1)space
  public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
      int res = 0;
      for(int num : nums){
          res ^= num;
      }
      return res;
  }
  ```
