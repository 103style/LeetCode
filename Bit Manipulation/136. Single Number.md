# [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
---

> Given a `non-empty` array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
>
> ### Note:
> Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: [2,2,1]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
> Output: 4
> ```
