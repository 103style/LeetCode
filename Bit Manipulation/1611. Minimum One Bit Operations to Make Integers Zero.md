> Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:
> * Change the rightmost (0<sup>th</sup>) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
> * Change the i<sup>th</sup> bit in the binary representation of `n` if the (i-1)<sup>th</sup> bit is set to `1` and the (i-2)<sup>th</sup> through 0<sup>th</sup> bits are set to `0`.
>
> Return the minimum number of operations to transform `n` into `0`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: n = 0
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: n = 3
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
> "11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
> "01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: n = 6
> Output: 4
> Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
> "110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
> "010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
> "011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
> "001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: n = 9
> Output: 14
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: n = 333
> Output: 393
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `0 <= n <= 10^9`
