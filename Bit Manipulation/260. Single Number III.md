# [260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which `exactly two elements` appear only `once` and all the other elements appear exactly `twice`.
Find the two elements that appear `only once`.

### Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

### Note:
* The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
* Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

### Solution
* java
  * mime `Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 99.80%, Memory Usage: 39.9 MB, less than 26.67% of Java online submissions.`

      }
      int lowbit = t & (-t);
      int[] res = new int[2];
      for(int num : nums){
          if((num & lowbit) == lowbit){
              res[0] ^= num;
          }else{
              res[1] ^= num;
          }
      }
      return res;
