# [260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which `exactly two elements` appear only `once` and all the other elements appear exactly `twice`.
Find the two elements that appear `only once`.

### Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

### Note:
* The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
* Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

### Solution
* java
  * mime `Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 99.80%, Memory Usage: 39.9 MB, less than 26.67% of Java online submissions.`

  //O(n)time  O(1)space
  public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
      int t = 0;
      for(int num : nums){
          t ^= num;
      }
      int lowbit = t & (-t);
      int[] res = new int[2];
      for(int num : nums){
          if((num & lowbit) == lowbit){
              res[0] ^= num;
          }else{
              res[1] ^= num;
          }
      }
      return res;
  }

  we have array [1,2,1,3,2,5].
  if we group it like  [2,2,3] and [1,1,5], so we can use xor to get the res [3,5].
  how to group this array like it?
  
  we can you xor loop the array to get the num t.
  int t = 1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 5 = 3 ^ 5 = 0b0011 ^ 0b0101 = 0b0110
  we can use the any bit if value is 1. 
  so we can choose 0b0010  or 0b0100.
  
  wo choose the lowbit ob0010, we can use t & (-t) to get it.
  int lowbit = t & (-t) = 0b00110 & (0b11001 + 1 ) = 0b00110 & 0b11010 = 0b00010.
  
  then we create a res = new int[2], and loop the array, 
  if (num & lowbit) == lowbit, we put res[0] ^= num,
  else we put res[0] ^= num,
  so we can group the array with [2,3,3] and [1,1,5].
