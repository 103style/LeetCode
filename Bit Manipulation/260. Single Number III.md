> **Difficulty** : **Medium**
> 
> **Related Topics** : **Bit Manipulation**

---

> Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which `exactly two elements` appear only `once` and all the other elements appear exactly `twice`.
> Find the two elements that appear `only once`.
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
> Output: [3,5]
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
> * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

      ```
      //O(n)time  O(1)space
      public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
          int t = 0;
          for(int num : nums){
              t ^= num;
          }
          int diff = (~t + 1) & t; // or (-t) & t
          int x = 0, y = 0;
          for(int num : nums){
              if((num & diff) != 0){
                  x ^= num;
              }else{
                  y ^= num;
              }
          }
          return new int[]{x, y};
      }
      ```
      
      ```
      we have array [1,2,1,3,2,5].
      if we group it like  [2,2,3] and [1,1,5], so we can use xor to get the res [3,5].
      how to group this array like it?

      we can you xor loop the array to get the num t.
      int t = 1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 5 = 3 ^ 5 = 0b0011 ^ 0b0101 = 0b0110
      we can use the any bit if value is 1. 
      so we can choose 0b0010  or 0b0100.

      we choose the lowbit ob0010, we can use t & (-t) or t & (~t + 1) to get it.
      int lowbit = t & (-t) = 0b00110 & (0b11001 + 1 ) = 0b00110 & 0b11010 = 0b00010.

      then we create a res = new int[2], and loop the array, 
      if (num & lowbit) == lowbit, we put res[0] ^= num,
      else we put res[0] ^= num,
      so we can group the array with [2,2,3] and [1,1,5],
      and get the result [3,5]
      ```
