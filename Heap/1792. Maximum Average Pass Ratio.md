> There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam.
> You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]`.
> You know beforehand that in the `i`^`th` class, there are `total`<sub>`i`</sub> total students, but only `pass`<sub>`i`</sub> number of students will pass the exam.
>
> You are also given an integer `extraStudents`.
> There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are **guaranteed** to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to.
> You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that **maximizes** the **average** pass ratio across **all** the classes.
>
> The **pass ratio** of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class.
> The **average pass ratio** is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.
>
> Return the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning the `extraStudents` students.
> Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2
> Output: 0.78333
> Explanation: You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4
> Output: 0.53485
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= classes.length <= 10^5`
> * `classes[i].length == 2`
> * `1 <= pass`<sub>`i`</sub>` <= total`<sub>`i`</sub>` <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= extraStudents <= 10^5`
