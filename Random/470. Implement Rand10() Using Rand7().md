> Given a function `rand7` which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function `rand10` which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.
>
> Do NOT use system's `Math.random()`.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: 1
> Output: [7]
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: 2
> Output: [8,4]
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: 3
> Output: [8,1,10]
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `rand7` is predefined.
> * Each testcase has one argument: `n`, the number of times that `rand10` is called.
>
>
> ### Follow up:
> * What is the expected value for the number of calls to `rand7()` function?
> * Could you minimize the number of calls to `rand7()`?
