> Given a list of **non-overlapping** axis-aligned rectangles `rects`, write a function `pick` which randomly and uniformily picks an **integer point** in the space covered by the rectangles.
> 
> ### Note:
> * An **integer point** is a point that has integer coordinates.
> * A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is **included** in the space covered by the rectangles.
> * `i`th rectangle = `rects[i]` = `[x1,y1,x2,y2]`, where `[x1, y1]` are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `[x2, y2]` are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
> * length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
> * `1 <= rects.length <= 100`
> * `pick` return a point as an array of integer coordinates `[p_x, p_y]`
> * `pick` is called at most `10000` times.
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input:
> ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
> [[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
> Output:
> [null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input:
> ["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
> [[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
> Output:
> [null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
> ```
> 
> ### Explanation of Input Syntax:
> * The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles `rects`. `pick` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
