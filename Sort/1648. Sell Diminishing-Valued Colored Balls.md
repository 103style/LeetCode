> You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.
>
> The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color** you currently have in your `inventory`.
> For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball.
> After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).
>
> You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> color that you initially own.
> You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.
>
> Return the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling `orders` colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/jj.gif)
> ```
> Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
> Output: 14
> Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
> The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
> Output: 19
> Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).
> The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: inventory = [2,8,4,10,6], orders = 20
> Output: 110
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: inventory = [1000000000], orders = 1000000000
> Output: 21
> Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1000000000 times for a total value of 500000000500000000. 500000000500000000 modulo 109 + 7 = 21.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5`
> * `1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9`
> * `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 10^9)`
