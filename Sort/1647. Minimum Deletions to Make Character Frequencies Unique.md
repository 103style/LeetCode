> A string `s` is called **good** if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same **frequency**.
>
> Given a string `s`, return the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make `s` **good**.
>
> The **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string.
> For example, in the string `"aab"`, the **frequency** of `'a'` is `2`, while the **frequency** of `'b'` is `1`.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: s = "aab"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: s is already good.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
> Output: 2
> Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
> Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: s = "ceabaacb"
> Output: 2
> Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
> Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
> * `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

      ```
      //O(N)time or O(26*log26)time
      //O(N)space
      public int minDeletions(String s) {
          int[] arr = new int[26];
          for(char c : s.toCharArray()){
              arr[c - 'a']++;
