> Given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the **same length**.
>
> The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `i` <sup>`th`</sup> position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.
>
> Return the shuffled string.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/q1.jpg)
> ```
> Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
> Output: "leetcode"
> Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
> Output: "abc"
> Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: s = "aiohn", indices = [3,1,4,2,0]
> Output: "nihao"
> ```
>
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: s = "aaiougrt", indices = [4,0,2,6,7,3,1,5]
> Output: "arigatou"
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: s = "art", indices = [1,0,2]
> Output: "rat"
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `s.length == indices.length == n`
> * `1 <= n <= 100`
> * `s` contains only lower-case English letters.
> * `0 <= indices[i] < n`
> * All values of `indices` are unique (i.e. `indices` is a permutation of the integers from `0` to `n - 1`).

      // O(N)time
      // O(N)space
      public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
          int n = s.length();
          char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
          char[] res = new char[n];
          for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
              res[indices[i]] = arr[i];
          }
          return new String(res);
      }
