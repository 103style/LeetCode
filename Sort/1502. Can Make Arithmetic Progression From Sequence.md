Given an `array` of numbers arr. A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise, return `false`.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
``` 

### Constraints:
* `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * **Arrays.sort** `Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 99.73%, Memory Usage: 38.8 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      // O(N * logN)time
      // O(N)space
      public boolean canMakeArithmeticProgression(int[] arr) {
          Arrays.sort(arr);
          int d = arr[1] - arr[0];
          for(int i = 2; i < arr.length; i++){
              if(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != d){
                  return false;
              }
          }
          return true;
      }
      ```
