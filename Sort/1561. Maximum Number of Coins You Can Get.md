> There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:
> * In each step, you will choose **any** 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
> * Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
> * You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
> * Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
> * Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
>
> Given an array of integers `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of coins in the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> pile.
>
> Return the maximum number of coins which you can have.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
> Output: 9
> Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
> Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
> The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
> On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.\
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: piles = [2,4,5]
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: piles = [9,8,7,6,5,1,2,3,4]
> Output: 18
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `3 <= piles.length <= 10^5`
> * `piles.length % 3 == 0`
> * `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4`
