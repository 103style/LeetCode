> Given n `points` on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area.
>
> A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with the maximum width.
>
> Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered included in the area.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png)
> ```
> Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `n == points.length`
> * `2 <= n <= 10^5`
> * `points[i].length == 2`
> * `0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9`
