**same as leetcode Daily Challenge June 18th,2020---[275. H-Index II](https://github.com/103style/LeetCode/blob/master/Binary%20Search/275.%20H-Index%20II.md)**

---

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have **at least** h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have **no more than** h citations each."

### Example:
```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note**: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
