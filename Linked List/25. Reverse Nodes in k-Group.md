# [25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

### Example:

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For k = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For k = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

### Note:
* Only constant extra memory is allowed.
* You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
