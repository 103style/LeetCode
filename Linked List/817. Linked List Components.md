# [817. Linked List Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components/)

We are given `head`, the head node of a linked list containing **unique integer values**.

We are also given the list `G`, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in `G`, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
```

### Note:
* If `N` is the length of the linked list given by head, `1 <= N <= 10000`.
* The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range `[0, N - 1]`.
* `1 <= G.length <= 10000`.
* `G` is a subset of all values in the linked list.
