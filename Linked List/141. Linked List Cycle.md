> Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
>
> There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.
> Internally,`pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.
>
> Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.
>
> ### Follow up:
> * Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![Example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
> ```
> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> Output: true
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
> ```
>
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![Example2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
> ```
> Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
> Output: true
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
> ```
>
>
> ### Example 3:
> ![Example3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
> ```
> Input: head = [1], pos = -1
> Output: false
> Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
> * `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
> * `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.
