> Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
>
> Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/05/graph-1.png)
> ```
> Input: head = [1,0,1]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: head = [0]
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: head = [1]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ###Example 4:
> ```
> Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
> Output: 18880
> ```
>
> ### Example 5:
> ```
> Input: head = [0,0]
> Output: 0
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * The Linked List is not empty.
> * Number of nodes will not exceed `30`.
> * Each node's value is either `0` or `1`.

          int res = 0;
          while(head != null){
              res = res << 1 | head.val;
              head = head.next;
          }
          return res;
      }
