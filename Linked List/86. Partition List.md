# [86. Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

### Example:
```
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```

        return s.next;
    }

        curr2.next = null;          //important! avoid cycle in linked list. otherwise u will get TLE.
        curr1.next = dummy2.next;
        return dummy1.next;
    }
