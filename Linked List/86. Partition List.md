> Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
>
> You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
>
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
> Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
> ```
