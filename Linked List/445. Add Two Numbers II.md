# 445. [Add Two Numbers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/description/)

You are given two `non-empty` linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Follow up:

What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.

### Example:
    Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
    Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
