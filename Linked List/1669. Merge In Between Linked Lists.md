> You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.
> 
> Remove `list1`'s nodes from the `a`<sup>`th`</sup> node to the `b`<sup>`th`</sup> node, and put `list2` in their place.
> 
> The blue edges and nodes in the following figure incidate the result:
> 
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/fig1.png)
> Build the result list and return its head.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/merge_linked_list_ex1.png)
> ```
> Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
> Output: [0,1,2,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
> Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ![3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/merge_linked_list_ex2.png)
> ```
> Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
> Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
> Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `3 <= list1.length <= 10^4`
> * `1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1`
> * `1 <= list2.length <= 10^4`
