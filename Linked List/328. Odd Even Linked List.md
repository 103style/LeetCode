> Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
> 
> You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
> Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
> Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
> * The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
> * The length of the linked list is between `[0, 10^4]`.
