> Given a positive integer `K`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest** positive integer `N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`, and `N` only contains the digit `1`.
>
> Return the **length** of `N`. If there is no such `N`, return `-1`.
>
> **Note**: `N` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: K = 1
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: K = 2
> Output: -1
> Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: K = 3
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= K <= 10^5`
