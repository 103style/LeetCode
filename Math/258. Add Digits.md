> Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
> 
> ### Example:
> ```
> Input: 38
> Output: 2 
> Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
>              Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
> ```
> 
> ### Follow up:
> * Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

### Solution
* **mine**
  * **Java**
    * `Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 100.00%, Memory Usage: 36.2 MB, less than 97.48% of Java online submissions`
      ```
      //O(N^2)time   N is num.length
      //O(1)space
      public int addDigits(int num) {
          int res = num;
          while(res > 9){
              int t = 0;
              while(res > 0){
                  t += res % 10;
                  res /= 10;
              }
              res = t;
          }
          return res;
      }
      ```
