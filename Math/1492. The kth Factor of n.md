# [1492. The kth Factor of n](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-kth-factor-of-n/)

---

**the second one in Biweekly Contest 29.**

---

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`.

A factor of an integer `n` is defined as an integer `i` where `n % i == 0`.

Consider a list of all factors of `n` sorted in **ascending order**, return the kth factor in this list or return **-1** if `n` has less than `k` factors.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Factors list is [1], the 1st factor is 1.
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: n = 1000, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000].
```
