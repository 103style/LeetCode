> You have an array `arr` of length `n` where `arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1` for all valid values of `i` (i.e. `0 <= i < n`).
>
> In one operation, you can select two indices `x` and `y` where `0 <= x, y < n` and subtract `1` from `arr[x]` and add `1` to `arr[y]` (i.e. perform `arr[x] -=1` and `arr[y] += 1`). The goal is to make all the elements of the array **equal**. It is **guaranteed** that all the elements of the array can be made equal using some operations.
>
> Given an integer `n`, the length of the array. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of arr equal.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: n = 3
> Output: 2
> Explanation: arr = [1, 3, 5]
> First operation choose x = 2 and y = 0, this leads arr to be [2, 3, 4]
> In the second operation choose x = 2 and y = 0 again, thus arr = [3, 3, 3].
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: n = 6
> Output: 9
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= n <= 10^4`

              if( t >= mid) break;
              res+= mid - t;
