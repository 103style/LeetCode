> You are standing at position `0` on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position `target`.
>
> On each move, you can either go left or right. During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.
>
> Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: target = 3
> Output: 2
> Explanation:
> On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
> On the second step we step from 1 to 3.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: target = 2
> Output: 3
> Explanation:
> On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
> On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.
> On the third move we step from -1 to 2.
> ```
>
> ### Note:
> * `target` will be a non-zero integer in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.
