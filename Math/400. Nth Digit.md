> Find the n<sup>th</sup> digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...
>
> ### Note:
> * n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 2<sup>31</sup>).
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input:
> 3
>
> Output:
> 3
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input:
> 11
>
> Output:
> 0
>
> Explanation:
> The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

              n -= m;
              m = 9 * (long) (Math.pow(10, i - 1)) * i;
          }

          int s = (int) (Math.pow(10, i - 1)) - 1;
          //find n can make how many num whose length is i, then add it
          s += n / i;
          //made n mod i
          n = n % i;
          //if n == 0, res is the last num in before number
          int res = s % 10;
          //else make s++, and find the nth num
          s++;
          while (n > 0) {
