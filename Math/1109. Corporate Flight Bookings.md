# [1109. Corporate Flight Bookings](https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/)

There are `n` flights, and they are labeled from `1` to `n`.

We have a list of flight bookings.  The `i-th` booking `bookings[i] = [i, j, k]` means that we booked `k` seats from flights labeled `i` to `j` inclusive.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
``` 

### Constraints:
* `1 <= bookings.length <= 20000`
* `1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000`
* `1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000`
