> Given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of '0' and '1's).
> 
> Return the number of substrings with all characters 1's.
> 
> Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo **10^9 + 7**.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: s = "0110111"
> Output: 9
> Explanation: There are 9 substring in total with only 1's characters.
> "1" -> 5 times.
> "11" -> 3 times.
> "111" -> 1 time.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "101"
> Output: 2
> Explanation: Substring "1" is shown 2 times in s.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: s = "111111"
> Output: 21
> Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 4:
> ```
> Input: s = "000"
> Output: 0
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `s[i] == '0' or s[i] == '1'`
> * `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
