# 537. [Complex Number Multiplication](https://leetcode.com/problems/complex-number-multiplication/description/)

Given two strings representing two [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.

### Example 1:
    Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
    Output: "0+2i"
    Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.

### Example 2:
    Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
    Output: "0+-2i"
    Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.

### Note:
* The input strings will not have extra blank.
* The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.

### Solution
* **java**
```
