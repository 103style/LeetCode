> Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
> 
> Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`.
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: 6
> Output: true
> Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: 8
> Output: true
> Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
> ```
> 
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: 14
> Output: false
> Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
> ```
> 
> ### Note:
> * `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
> * Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1].
