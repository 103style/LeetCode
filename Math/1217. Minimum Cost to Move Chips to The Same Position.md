> We have `n` chips, where the position of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> chip is `position[i]`.
>
> We need to move all the chips to **the same position**. In one step, we can change the position of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> chip from `position[i]` to:
> * `position[i] + 2` or `position[i] - 2` with `cost = 0`
> * `position[i] + 1` or `position[i] - 1` with `cost = 1.`
> Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/15/chips_e1.jpg)
> ```
> Input: position = [1,2,3]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
> Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
> Total cost is 1.
> ```
>
> ### Example 2:
> ![2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/15/chip_e2.jpg)
> ```
> Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: We can move the two chips at poistion 3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.
> ```
>
> ### Example 3:
> ```
> Input: position = [1,1000000000]
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> ### Constraints:
> * `1 <= position.length <= 100`
> * `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`

          int odd = 0, even = 0;
          for(int i : position){
              if(i % 2 == 0){
                  even++;
              }else{
                  odd++;
