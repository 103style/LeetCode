> There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.
> Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.
>
> The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0`th receptor.
>
> Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.  (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)
>
>
>
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: p = 2, q = 1
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.
> ```

> * `0 <= q <= p`
