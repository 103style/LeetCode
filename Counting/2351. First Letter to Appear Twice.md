> Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear **twice**.
> 
> ### Note:
> * A letter a appears twice before another letter `b` if the second occurrence of `a` is before the second occurrence of `b`.
> * `s` will contain at least one letter that appears twice.
> 
> 
> ### Example 1:
> ```
> Input: s = "abccbaacz"
> Output: "c"
> Explanation:
> The letter 'a' appears on the indexes 0, 5 and 6.
> The letter 'b' appears on the indexes 1 and 4.
> The letter 'c' appears on the indexes 2, 3 and 7.
> The letter 'z' appears on the index 8.
> The letter 'c' is the first letter to appear twice, because out of all the letters the index of its second occurrence is the smallest.
> ```
> 
> ### Example 2:
> ```
> Input: s = "abcdd"
> Output: "d"
> Explanation:
> The only letter that appears twice is 'd' so we return 'd'.
> ```
> 
> ### Constraints:
> * `2 <= s.length <= 100`
> * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
> * `s` has at least one repeated letter.
